# Personal Portfolio Samples

Welcome to my portfolio of software development projects. This repository showcases a range of applications and tools I have built, demonstrating my skills in AI integration, game development, and web application design. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a detailed `README.md` with setup instructions and more information.
